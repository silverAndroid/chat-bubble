# chat-bubble
This is my custom chat bubble view that I created for another project but I decided to open-source this since I couldn't find any that looked Material Design-like.

I'm currently trying to turn this into a Gradle project but to no success, so until I figure that out, you'll have to download [ChatBubble.java](chatbubble/src/main/java/com/rushil/chatbubble/ChatBubble.java) and add that to your src folder, then download [attrs.xml](chatbubble/src/main/res/values/attrs.xml) and add that to your /res/values folder.
